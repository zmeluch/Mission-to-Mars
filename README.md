# Mission to Mars

## Overview of Project
To help Robin in her pursuit of a job at NASA, a web app was developed. Pulling
different information on Mars from various webpages and then formatting and
presenting it on her own page. In order to accomplish this code was written
in jupyter notebook using beautiful soup to scrape the data, images and headlines
from the different webpages. Then using splinter to automate the task in a browser.
Then the code was exported and altered into a python file used to scrape and then
store the data into a mongo database. From there another python code was written
to run the scraping file and then take the info from the mongo database and display
it in the web app. Finally a html index file was used to format and style the page.
